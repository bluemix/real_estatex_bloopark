### Website Form
The process of creating and managing complaints starts when the user submits the complaint
using the website form, where there will be a new _Complain_ button that is added at the top menu bar
as shown:

When the entered information is validated, the Submit button will create a new complaint ticket
at the backend and a success webpage is shown to the user:
